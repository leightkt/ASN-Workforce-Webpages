				<h2>All-In Nephrology Match History</h2>
				<p>In 2015, the ASN Council unanimously approved an All-In Policy for the Nephrology Match. As the official sponsor of the Nephrology Match, ASN believes All-In is the best approach for the specialty in the long term and helps ensure all candidates: 1) have fair and equal access to programs and 2) can examine the full range of training opportunities before making a final decision. Moreover, the All-In Policy provides programs with an equitable system to evaluate candidates on an orderly and transparent schedule.</p>
				<p>Prior to implementation of the All-In Policy, participation in the Nephrology Match by fellowship applicants had declined significantly since 2010, while the number of training opportunities increased during the same time period. Match participation fell to an all-time low in December 2014. Although the number of Nephrology fellowship programs increased from 127 in 2000 to a high of 147 in 2013, and the number of fellows in their first or second year of training jumped from 626 to 930 in the same time period, the number of applicants participating in the Match has declined from a high of 576 in 2010 to 252 in the December 2014 Match for the 2015 appointment year.</p>
				<p>In the first year of All-In implementation, there was an increase in the number of participating programs and tracks. The number of unfilled positions and programs continued to rise in the AY 2016 application cycle, although the number of overall applicants increased slightly over AY 2015. In 2016 and 2017, all eligible Nephrology Training Programs voluntarily participated in the All-In Nephrology Match.</p>

				<h3>ERAS Access</h3>
				<p>Nephrology training programs participating in the All-In Nephrology Match will be listed in, and have access to, the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). ASN is again asking programs to sign a <a href="https://www.asn-online.org/education/training/match/ASN_Match_MOU_AY19.pdf" target="_blank">memorandum of understanding (MOU)</a> to provide ERAS the information it needs to verify programs/tracks participating in the AY 2019 All-In Nephrology Match.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">Track Recommendations</button>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Track Recommendations</h2>
					<p>Wide variability exists among internal medicine specialties in the use of program tracks in the Match. The ASN Nephrology Match Task Force discussions centered on whether offering too many tracks would create confusion for applicants in assessing programs and preparing rank lists. Preserving the ability of training programs to offer multiple tracks would enable programs to limit the number of applicants who match to specialized research or clinical programs (often supported by limited resources). Moreover, Nephrology fellows have indicated that multiple tracks demonstrate a programâ€™s commitment to provide a differentiated training experience.</p>
					<p>Noting that programs can use the NRMP system to "revert" unfilled positions to be filled from their rank list for their clinical track, the Task Force determined that Nephrology should maintain the flexibility of multiple tracks. However, the Task Force unanimously recommended reducing the number of tracks to three: "Clinical," "Research," and "Other" to minimize confusion.</p>
