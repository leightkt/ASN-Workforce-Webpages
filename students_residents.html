					<h3>Dr. Craig A. Shadur- Practing Nephrologist</h3>
						<img class="portrait" src="WFT_images/shadur.png" alt="a portrait of Dr. Shadur"/>
						<p>Everyone's career journey is fraught with difficult decisions on which road to take. My decision to go into private practice nephrology was relatively easy. As I was finishing my nephrology fellowship program I did a very careful self-evaluation and decided the parts of the specialty which I enjoyed the most were patient care, the ability to stay intellectually engaged, and interacting with residents and medical students. I found the perfect match for myself in a private practice setting in a community teaching hospital.</p>
						<p>The clinical practice of nephrology is somewhat unique. I act as a consultant to primary care providers and other specialists, but also act as a primary physician for my dialysis and transplant patients. Most of my days are split between seeing hospitalized patients in the morning and a private clinic in the afternoon. Hospitalized patients are often consultative (often acute kidney injury, but can also be every aspect of clinical nephrology) but also include my own patients who are admitted with acute medical or surgical problems. My afternoon clinic includes patients with anything from chronic kidney disease to nephrolithiasis, hypertension, electrolyte disorders, transplantation, and asymptomatic urinary sediment abnormalities. Four times a month I make dialysis rounds in our hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis unit (a duty that I share with our physician's assistant).</p>
						<p>Despite a full schedule I always have time to visit with my partners to discuss challenging patients and to spend time teaching our internal medicine residents and medical students. I also have ample time for my family, volunteer actives at our local art museum, and attendance at national and regional medical meetings. Thirty-two years after making my career choice I remain excited about taking care of patients with kidney disease and feel fortunate I made my career choice in the clinical practice of nephrology.</p>

					<h3>Dr. Lauren Stern- Clinician Educator</h3>
						<img src="WFT_images/stern.png" alt="a portrait of Dr. Stern">
						<p>I am a clinician educator in the Renal Section at the Boston University School of Medicine. Being a clinician in a large academic medical center gives me the opportunity to see interesting patients with diverse backgrounds and disease, to take part in the education of students and house staff, and to have easy access to experts in many different fields.</p>
						<p>Since nephrology is a very diverse field, I have the opportunity to take part in a wide variety of clinical activities at my job. A typical day for me usually begins in the general nephrology clinic where I see patients with chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, nephrolithiasis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, and glomerular disease, to name a few. I also have the opportunity of seeing patients at our multi-specialty amyloidosis referral center. This clinic gives me the opportunity to work in conjunction with a team of specialists including oncologists, cardiologists, rheumatologists, and pulmonologists. After clinic, I often participate in house staff educational activities during the noon conference session. My teaching duties include giving talks on general nephrology topics and mediating case conferences. In the afternoon, I round on a shift of hemodialysis patients. I like that rounding weekly in a chronic hemodialysis unit gives me the opportunity to get to know my patients not just medically, but also on a personal level.</p>
						<p>The ability to interact with medical students, residents, and fellows is one of the things I enjoy most about my job. Getting to see an interesting patient through the eyes of a student or resident who is experiencing it for the first time makes rounds exciting. I always enjoyed being a student, and working in an academic medical center allows me to continue learning on a daily basis.</p>
						<p>Having a work-life balance is also important to me. I try to make a little time everyday (well, almost!) to focus on activities that I enjoy outside of work. Enjoying time with family and friends, having an interesting and challenging career, remaining physically active and getting lost in a good (non-medical) book is what life is all about for me.</p>

					<h3>Dr. Michel Melamed- Clinical Researcher</h3>
						<img src="WFT_images/melamed.png" alt="a portrait of Dr. Melamed">
						<p>Clinical researchers perform the studies that help shape nephrology clinical practice. Some clinical researchers are on a tenure research track at their academic institution, meaning that they are expected to obtain outside grant support and have protected time for their research (75-80%). Most clinical researchers on the tenure track obtain advanced degrees, such as Master or Doctorate level degrees during their fellowships, to be able to perform large epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. This advanced training in biostatistics and epidemiology helps clinical researchers to better design studies, analyze their own research and obtain extramural research funding. Many clinicians perform clinical research in addition to their clinical responsibilities but are not expected to obtain extramural grant funding and may or may not have obtained additional research training. Some medical schools have a clinician-educator track, in which clinicians are expected to have some scholarly activity but not as much as physicians on the clinical research tenure-track. Individuals must evaluate their own institution's policies regarding expectations about the number of publications and grant funding for the different tracks.</p>
						<p>A day in the life of a tenure-track clinical investigator may involve any of the following: 1) meeting with other members of the research team, i.e. biostatisticians, graduate students, etc. to discuss results of analyses and the next research steps; 2) writing research results and grants; 3) meeting with research coordinators to discuss participant recruitment and retention in clinical studies; 4) submitting Institutional Review Board proposals and progress reports; 5) peer review of manuscripts and grants; and 6) budgeting and planning current and future grant funding. As a junior investigator, the focus is on obtaining a first grant. Once that is achieved, a solid publication record is the key to future grant funding and promotion. For a more senior investigator, publications are still important, but as a senior author, the role evolves to editing rather than primarily writing manuscripts. At all points, writing grants is important and may involve sleepless nights for investigators who work best at the last minute. Most tenure track clinical researchers have clinical responsibilities that may include 1-3 months on the inpatient service, a dialysis shift, 1-2 half day clinics per week or some combination of the above. Clinicians who also do research but do not have extramural grant funding must find time in their busy days to perform research.</p>
						<p>In some ways, tenure-track clinical investigators may have more flexibility with their time compared to clinicians and may have an easier time with work-life balance. It is easier to cancel and re-schedule a meeting with a statistician or research coordinator than with a panel full of patients when a child is sick at home. One can also work on manuscripts and grants at home after children go to sleep. However, there is potentially also more travel for tenure-track clinical researchers than for clinicians, such as traveling to national meetings and to other academic institutions to promote one's research.</p>

					<h3>Alexander Wiseman- Transplant Nephrologist</h3>
						<img src="WFT_images/Wiseman.png" alt="a portrait of Dr. Wiseman">
						<p>The clinical "sub-subspecialization" of transplant nephrology evolved in response to the growing success of the field of kidney transplantation and the inevitable need for physicians who could focus specifically on the unique issues of the immunosuppressed patient. Kidney transplant outcomes have reached success rates of 90-95% at one year following transplant, with longer-term (10 year) graft survival approaching 50%. Given this success and growing numbers of patients requiring long-term management, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) was contracted by the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) to set minimum experience requirements for Medical Directors of kidney transplant programs. Over time, the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Nephrology developed specific fellowship curricula and accreditation programs that emulated these requirements in order to ensure adequate numbers of well-trained individuals who could meet the growing needs of transplant programs. At present, this entails a one-year fellowship for board-certified/board eligible nephrologists (for most, this usually follows the second or third year of general nephrology fellowship training). Those who complete training are competitive for positions in academic transplant programs, hospital-based kidney transplant programs, and within private practices that maintain large numbers of transplant patients in follow-up. This training can be combined with research-based training both in the clinical and basic science areas.</p>
						<p>An informal poll of the day-to-day life of a transplant nephrologist would reveal an in-depth application of immunology, nephrology, and general internal medicine with strong elements of ethics in medicine. Applying immunology is a daily practice, with interpretation of HLA testing, crossmatch results, and post-transplant manipulation of antibody- and T cell-mediated injury using proven and novel immunosuppressive strategies. General internal medicine principles of cardiovascular risk assessment and management, endocrinology (diabetes, bone disease, lipid management), infectious disease, and malignancy risk combined with the interplay with these risks with immunosuppression lead to unique presentations in the transplant recipient requiring management by a "sub-subspecialist". The risk of recurrent glomerular disease and immunologic injury requires cutting-edge knowledge of genetic, immunologic, and metabolic diseases related to kidney disease. Lastly, the ethical issues of transplantation, beginning with a the concept of rationing a scare resource (organ donors), to the health and welfare of living donors, to the ongoing debates of payments to donors and the methodology of "donor swaps" when immunologic incompatibility prevents a willing and able donor from donating to a loved one, make the day-to-day life an exciting, intellectually challenging field. As the ultimate reward, the patients who receive kidney transplants are truly transformed and (for the most part) motivated and dedicated patients, and the success of medical science that transplantation represents is something to appreciate every day.</p>
						<p>From a quality-of-life perspective, there is significant flexibility for the transplant nephrologist, not only in job description but also in the work-life balance. The academic transplant nephrologist may spend 25-75% of his or her time in direct patient care, with the remainder spent in policy development (OPTN/UNOS), research (examples include outcomes research from large and local databases, basic immunology research, and translational research), and educational efforts locally, nationally, and within transplant organizations. Clinician-educator positions are common in transplant nephrology given the growing need for expert management of a unique patient population. Outside of academic medical centers, many opportunities exist in Transplant Centers that are managed by private hospitals and large nephrology groups. Job opportunities are more geographically limited than general nephrology practice since most Transplant Centers are in larger metropolitan areas. Often the workday is primarily clinic-based and involves working prominently as the leader of a multidisciplinary team of social workers, nurse coordinators, pharmacists, financial coordinators, and dieticians in collaboration with transplant surgeons. While dialysis and "on-call" activities still exist, they generally are less than other nephrology professional tracks. Compensation is often not based on dialysis income, but usually is recognized by the Transplant Center as a critical value and is typically supported by hospital support and/or nephrology group support to at least equal levels of general nephrology income.</p>

					<h3>Dr. Linda Francisco- Interventional Nephrologist</h3>
						<img src="WFT_images/francisco.png" alt="a portrait of Dr. Francisco">
						<p>I was originally attracted to nephrology while in medical school and then again, as a resident, when I was impressed with the diagnostic skills of the nephrologists that I observed. The nephrologists were able to diagnose and manage patients that most other physicians would prefer to refer to other subspecialties. Their breadth and depth of knowledge were beyond other physicians that I had contact with during training and I was awed by their skills. After subsequent training in a fellowship in nephrology and working in private practice, I began to understand the importance of the vascular access for a dialysis patient, not only for the quality of the dialysis they would receive but also in the quality of life for the dialysis patient. Frequent trips to the hospital with thrombosed or malfunctioning accesses, sometimes requiring many days of hospitalization and multiple surgeries, resulted in the conclusion in my own mind that there must be a better way to manage these problems. I then was exposed to other nephrologists in the country with similar concerns and became aware of the emphasis of training in vascular access available to the nephrologists. So began my quest in interventional nephrology.</p>
						<p>I have been practicing interventional nephrology for 10 years in addition to my private practice of nephrology. I spend two weeks in my office seeing renal, transplant, and hypertensive patients, doing hospital rounds with consultative nephrology, and then rounds on the chronic dialysis patients in the chronic dialysis units. This is then followed by one week in the Interventional Unit concentrating on vascular access work, which involves angiograms, angioplasties, and thrombectomies. I share the interventional responsibilities with two other partners in my group (thus the three-week rotation). This rotational schedule allows me the freedom to continue to practice nephrology as well as my personal interest in vascular access. There are generally 7-12 cases per day in the Interventional Unit, with each case taking about 30-60 minutes. There is immediate gratification with the procedures, as there is improvement in the function of the access and the appreciation of the patient to return to their dialysis within 1-2 hours after the original referral to the Intervention Unit.</p>
						<p>In addition to practicing nephrology and interventional nephrology, I have been fortunate to be married to a wonderful person who supports my goals in life. We have 3 adult children, 2 of whom are married and we are blessed with a granddaughter who is the "love of our life." We are also very active in the community in a variety of activities in the Art Museum, Symphony, Opera, and on a variety of boards in the community. We also work in active roles in the medical staffs in the hospitals and in the county medical society.</p>

							<p>I obtained both an MD and a PhD, as I envisioned that my career would have both patient care and research components. During the clinical years in medical school I missed the research world, so I decided to apply to programs that offered strong training in nephrology basic research and grant writing in a collaborative environment. For my fellowship training I spent three years in the lab and the last year in clinical training. During the last of the three research years, I applied for and received a National Institutes of Health (NIH) K08 grant. In my first year as a junior faculty member, I took courses that offered training on how to negotiate, how to manage a lab, and how to write grants and scientific papers. After the first year of K08 support, I relocated for family reasons. I was offered a position at my current location, starting as an Assistant Professor. I also became very involved in the organization Women in Nephrology (WIN), which offered me many opportunities for leadership. For example, I learned how to organize a meeting by becoming one of the junior co-chairs for the WIN-ASN Professional Development Seminar at Kidney Week. The more senior WIN members were also sources of advice, mentorship and inspiration.</p>
							<p>Overall, the daily schedule for a physician-scientist depends on whether one is "on (clinical) service" or not, and 8-10 weeks out of the year I am "on". In general, I check my patients' labs early in the morning using electronic remote access to patient data provided by the hospital. Afterwards, I exercise, do laundry, and take care of my children by getting them breakfast and to school on time. Triage of tasks is essential on these days, because coordinating lab work when I am on service takes at least two hours. When I am on service, I take care of the "important and urgent" matters first, which is the clinical service. Then I touch base with the lab members. I find it important that my lab members feel that they can reach me any time via email or phone. So my smartphone is an essential piece of equipment when I am on the wards. After I have seen my patients and attend the noon conference, I round with the team. I spend at least two hours on lab/research related paperwork in the afternoon after rounding, checking my list of tasks, and completing as many of those as possible. When I get home at around 7 pm, I cook dinner, eat with the family and then I read about and co-sign the notes on patients that were seen late in the day. Depending on the day, I can do some additional research-related work before going to sleep.</p>
							<p>When I am not on service, I arrive at work and touch base with the members of my lab. I perform microscopy every day if the slides are ready. I often spend one hour every day coordinating experiments with collaborators. Once a week we try to hold a more general lab meeting and on average, every other week I participate in a physiology experiment with other members of the lab. I try to reserve time for writing during the daytime (grants or papers or both), but oftentimes meetings and conferences during the day leave little time for writing. I do most of my writing in the evening after everybody else in the house is asleep.</p>
							<p>My work-life balance is no different than that of any small business owner. I work long hours, but I try to work from home as much as possible. I take vacations, but they are short. I have a good network of colleagues and friends. I keep in touch mostly via email with friends and colleagues across the country, and we have developed a strong network for advice and support. I try to give back to the community of nephrologists and researchers by volunteering to help local and national organizations. I use the weekends to catch up on household-related work. A couple of years ago we invited a worldrenowned nephrologist and researcher to speak at our institution. She has been very successful in her career, and her children are now grown. I wondered if she had any advice for junior women on how to combine work and family during the critical early career stage. She thought about it for a second and then she said: "I would tell junior nephrologists/researchers to work very hard, to pay their baby-sitter very well, and to let their house get as dirty as they can possibly stand it". I have been following this advice for a while.</p>

						<p>Clinical researchers perform the studies that help shape nephrology clinical practice. Some clinical researchers are on a tenure research track at their academic institution, meaning that they are expected to obtain outside grant support and have protected time for their research (75-80%). Most clinical researchers on the tenure track obtain advanced degrees, such as Master or Doctorate level degrees during their fellowships, to be able to perform large epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. This advanced training in biostatistics and epidemiology helps clinical researchers to better design studies, analyze their own research and obtain extramural research funding. Many clinicians perform clinical research in addition to their clinical responsibilities but are not expected to obtain extramural grant funding and may or may not have obtained additional research training. Some medical schools have a clinician-educator track, in which clinicians are expected to have some scholarly activity but not as much as physicians on the clinical research tenure-track. Individuals must evaluate their own institution's policies regarding expectations about the number of publications and grant funding for the different tracks.</p>
						<p>A day in the life of a tenure-track clinical investigator may involve any of the following: 1) meeting with other members of the research team, i.e. biostatisticians, graduate students, etc. to discuss results of analyses and the next research steps; 2) writing research results and grants; 3) meeting with research coordinators to discuss participant recruitment and retention in clinical studies; 4) submitting Institutional Review Board proposals and progress reports; 5) peer review of manuscripts and grants; and 6) budgeting and planning current and future grant funding. As a junior investigator, the focus is on obtaining a first grant. Once that is achieved, a solid publication record is the key to future grant funding and promotion. For a more senior investigator, publications are still important, but as a senior author, the role evolves to editing rather than primarily writing manuscripts. At all points, writing grants is important and may involve sleepless nights for investigators who work best at the last minute. Most tenure track clinical researchers have clinical responsibilities that may include 1-3 months on the inpatient service, a dialysis shift, 1-2 half day clinics per week or some combination of the above. Clinicians who also do research but do not have extramural grant funding must find time in their busy days to perform research.</p>
						<p>In some ways, tenure-track clinical investigators may have more flexibility with their time compared to clinicians and may have an easier time with work-life balance. It is easier to cancel and re-schedule a meeting with a statistician or research coordinator than with a panel full of patients when a child is sick at home. One can also work on manuscripts and grants at home after children go to sleep. However, there is potentially also more travel for tenure-track clinical researchers than for clinicians, such as traveling to national meetings and to other academic institutions to promote one's research.</p>
