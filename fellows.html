				<h2>Fellows Connect</h2>
					<p>The ASN Fellows Connect Community is a closed online forum for current Nephrology Fellows. This platform gives fellows the opportunity to connect with trainees from other instutions, ask questions, and share updates. You can visit the community <a href="http://community.asn-online.org/communities/community-home?CommunityKey=a808710f-33ef-4b8a-9a1f-c473914c920f" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<h2>Renal Fellow Network</h2>
					<p>The Renal Fellow Network, a website created by Dr. Nathan Hellman while a renal fellow at Harvard. Nathan's untimely death in the winter of 2010 was a shock to the renal community; his energy, wit and intelligence will be greatly missed. Renal fellows at Harvard and elsewhere currently maintain the Renal Fellow Network; it is intended as a nephrology learning site for fellows that is written by fellows. It also contains a blog that allows discussion of a wide range of nephrology-related topics. You can visit the site <a href="http://renalfellow.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
